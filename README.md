#Description
This is a multi module that implements a solution for pricegrabbing.
It doesn't include the scrapers or feeders requited to populate the model.
Since it's created with educational purpouses, it's not optimized. So, it may contain solutions not considered the best ones.
i.e. It may use a domain model and a persistence model.
